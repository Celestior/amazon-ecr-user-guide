# Setting Up with Amazon ECR<a name="get-set-up-for-amazon-ecr"></a>

If you've signed up for AWS and have been using Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\), you are close to being able to use Amazon ECR\. The setup process for the two services is similar, as Amazon ECR is an extension to Amazon ECS\. To use the AWS CLI with Amazon ECR, you must use a version of the AWS CLI that supports the latest Amazon ECR features\. If you do not see support for an Amazon ECR feature in the AWS CLI, you should upgrade to the latest version\. For more information, see [http://aws\.amazon\.com/cli/](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\.

Complete the following tasks to get set up for Amazon ECR\. If you have already completed any of these steps, you may skip them and move on to installing the custom AWS CLI\.

1. [Sign Up for AWS](#sign-up-for-aws)

1. [Create an IAM User](#create-an-iam-user)

1. [Install the AWS CLI](#install_aws_cli)

## Sign Up for AWS<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services, including Amazon ECR\. You are charged only for the services that you use\.

If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task\. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose **Sign\-in using root account credentials**\. Then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad\.

Note your AWS account number, because you'll need it for the next task\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="create-an-iam-user"></a>

Services in AWS, such as Amazon ECR, require that you provide credentials when you access them, so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources\. The console requires your password\. You can create access keys for your AWS account to access the command line interface or API\. However, we don't recommend that you access AWS using the credentials for your AWS account; we recommend that you use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) instead\. Create an IAM user, and then add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions or grant this user administrative permissions\. You can then access AWS using a special URL and the credentials for the IAM user\.

If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console\.

**To create an IAM user for yourself and add the user to an Administrators group**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, type **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**, select **Custom password**, and then type the new user's password in the text box\. You can optionally select **Require password reset** to force the user to create a new password the next time the user signs in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions** page, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** type **Administrators**\.

1. For **Filter policies**, select the check box for **AWS managed \- job function**\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags** to add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users, and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies to restrict users' permissions to specific AWS resources, go to [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

To sign in as this new IAM user, sign out of the AWS console, then use the following URL, where *your\_aws\_account\_id* is your AWS account number without the hyphens \(for example, if your AWS account number is `1234-5678-9012`, your AWS account ID is `123456789012`\):

```
https://your_aws_account_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

Enter the IAM user name and password that you just created\. When you're signed in, the navigation bar displays "*your\_user\_name* @ *your\_aws\_account\_id*"\.

If you don't want the URL for your sign\-in page to contain your AWS account ID, you can create an account alias\. From the IAM dashboard, choose **Create Account Alias** and enter an alias, such as your company name\. To sign in after you create an account alias, use the following URL:

```
https://your_account_alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

To verify the sign\-in link for IAM users for your account, open the IAM console and check under **IAM users sign\-in link** on the dashboard\.

For more information about IAM, see the [AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/)\.

## Install the AWS CLI<a name="install_aws_cli"></a>

You can use the AWS command line tools to issue commands at your system's command line to perform Amazon ECS and AWS tasks\. This can be faster and more convenient than using the console\. The command line tools are also useful for building scripts that perform AWS tasks\.

To use the AWS CLI with Amazon ECR, install the latest AWS CLI version \(Amazon ECR functionality is available in the AWS CLI starting with version 1\.9\.15\)\. You can check your AWS CLI version with the aws \-\-version command\. For information about installing the AWS CLI or upgrading it to the latest version, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

## Install Docker<a name="setup_install_docker"></a>

To use the Docker CLI with Amazon ECR, you must first install Docker on your system\. For information about installing Docker and getting familiar with the tools, see [Docker Basics for Amazon ECR](docker-basics.md)\.
